# Wildfire Image Classification Using CNN and Transfer Learning

## Project Overview

This project develops a wildfire image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2).

The objective is to automatically classify images into:

* Fire
* No Fire

The project supports disaster management and emergency response applications by assisting in wildfire detection.

## Dataset
